    <div class="textnews">
        <p>BEIJING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed on Monday that the guarantee ability of
            land element should be enhanced to ensure the high-quality development of regions which enjoy competitive
            strengths, and that the grassroots emergency management capacity should be further improved.

            Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the
            Central Military Commission, made the remarks when presiding over the fourth meeting of the central
            commission for deepening overall reform of the 20th CPC Central Committee, which he heads.

            The meeting reviewed and adopted guidelines regarding land administration system reform, promoting the
            overall green transition of China's economic and social development, enhancing grassroots emergency
            management capacity, and accelerating the formation of fundamental systems that support comprehensive
            innovation. It also reviewed and adopted the commission's work report for year 2023 as well as the
            commission's key work tasks in 2024.<br><br>

            During the meeting, Xi stressed that the land administration system should be optimized to more effectively
            coordinate with macroeconomic policies and regional development so that the land element can be utilized for
            greater precision and higher efficiency. Efforts should be made to enhance the ability of the land element
            to guarantee high-quality development in regions that enjoy competitive strengths.
        <blockquote class="highlight">
            Xi said that promoting the overall green transition of China's economic and social development is a
            fundamental policy to address problems related to resources, the environment and ecology, and that China
            will pursue such a transition in a comprehensive, coordinated, innovative and sound approach.</blockquote>
        <br>

        Aiming for the national goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality before
        2060, efforts will be made to coordinatively promote carbon emission reduction, pollution reduction, green
        development expansion and economic growth, and to integrate the concept of green development throughout the
        entire process of economic and social development, according to Xi.<br><br>

        He urged efforts to strengthen the grassroots emergency management capacity to promptly and effectively
        handle various disasters and accidents, and to secure the bottom line of safety.

        Xi also called for efforts to accelerate the building of basic systems for comprehensive innovation by
        closely focusing on the outstanding issues that restrict the deep integration of science and technology with
        the economy.

        Li Qiang, Wang Huning and Cai Qi, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC
        Central Committee and deputy directors of the commission for deepening overall reform, attended the meeting.

        China should improve fiscal, tax, financial, investment and pricing policies and relevant market-oriented
        mechanisms to support green and low-carbon transformation, and provide policy support and institutional
        guarantees for green transformation, the meeting said.<br><br>

        China should also improve the guarantee mechanism, increase basic investment, and strengthen emergency
        response and rescue capacities of various regions in line with local conditions such as population size,
        economic scale, characteristics of disasters and accidents, and the degree of safety risks, according to the
        meeting.

        On comprehensively supporting innovation, the meeting called for conducting the policy alignment assessment
        of newly unveiled measures and newly established systems to ensure policy synergy.
        <blockquote class="highlight">
            In the past year, China organized and implemented the reform of the Party and state institutions, improved
            the systems for Party leadership, optimized the responsibility allocation of institutions in key areas,
            including technology and finance, with reform tasks at the central level basically completed, the meeting
            said.</blockquote><br>

        This year is another important year of comprehensively deepening reform, according to the meeting.

        It is not only a continuation of the comprehensive deepening of reform since the third plenary session of
        the 18th CPC Central Committee, but also a new chapter of the new journey to promote Chinese modernization,
        the meeting said.

        China should continue to implement reform measures that help expand domestic demand, improve structure,
        boost confidence, ensure people's livelihoods, and forestall and defuse risks.

        Efforts should focus on addressing the most critical and urgent issues, and removing institutional obstacles
        that hinder the smooth progress of Chinese modernization.

        The meeting underlined the importance of fully motivating all sectors for reform, further building consensus
        on reform, and mobilizing the whole Party and whole country to advance and implement major reform
        tasks.<br><br>

        <p>HEFEI, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of the year, Volkswagen Anhui's MEB plant in Hefei City, the
            capital of east China's Anhui Province, has been functioning at full capacity to produce new energy vehicles
            (NEVs) for the European market.

            At the advanced factory, around 1,000 robots are assigned to perform various duties and automated guided
            vehicles carry materials in an orderly manner. At the same time, the industrial CT undertakes highly
            efficient quality analysis in real time.

            With an investment of over 30 billion yuan (about 4.22 billion U.S. dollars), Volkswagen has built a new hub
            in Hefei that covers the entire value chain from research and development (R&D) to manufacturing, sales and
            services of NEVs, with 1,200 R&D personnel.

            As China is accelerating the development of modern industrial systems and sci-tech innovation, many more
            enterprises like Volkswagen are prioritizing their investment in high-tech industries and seeking new
            business opportunities.<br><br>

            In 2023, China's actual foreign direct investment (FDI), which remained at a historically high level, hit
            more than 1.13 trillion yuan, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
        <blockquote class="highlight">
            In November 2023, American biotech company Moderna commenced construction of its first pharmaceutical plant
            in China, with an estimated investment of 3.6 billion yuan. In the same month, the construction of BMW's new
            battery production plant in Shenyang, northeast China's Liaoning Province, was completed.</blockquote><br>

        This year, China's high-tech industries are poised to remain focal points for foreign investors.

        The country's top economic planner recently launched a new batch of flagship foreign investment projects,
        with a planned total investment of over 15 billion U.S. dollars, covering fields including biomedicine,
        automobile manufacturing, power batteries and chemical engineering.

        The upgrading of China's consumer market and the enhancement of sci-tech innovation have also strengthened
        foreign enterprises' willingness to seek new businesses in China, said Wang Yaping, deputy general manager
        of Deloitte Hefei Branch.<br><br>

        While investing more in high-tech industries, many foreign enterprises began launching R&D centers and
        building local supply chains rather than just establishing production bases in China.

        Recently, Siemens officially opened the R&D center of industrial software in Shenzhen, south China's
        Guangdong Province. Last year, Volkswagen announced it would establish Volkswagen China Technology Company,
        its largest development center outside Germany, in Anhui.

        "With our 'in China for China' strategy, we will develop much more technology here in the future to make
        even better use of local innovative strength and respond more quickly to the needs of Chinese customers,"
        said Erwin Gabardi, CEO of Volkswagen Anhui.<br><br>

        <p>BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China will see some 2.311 billion passenger trips during this year's Spring
            Festival travel rush, transport authorities estimated on Saturday.

            About 2.184 billion trips, or 94.5 percent of the total, would be made on highways during the eight-day

            aviation trips would stand at 9.4 million and 18.04 million, respectively, according to the
            estimation.<br><br>

            The Chinese New Year holiday, which runs from Feb. 10 to 17 this year, is a peak time when people travel for
            family reunions, or sightseeing and recreation.

            On Friday, about 308.46 million passenger trips were made nationwide, up 34 percent from a year ago, data
            shows.<br><br>
            With the long holiday ending on Saturday, authorities have stepped up transport capacity to meet the surging
            travel demand and ensure safe and convenient trips.<br><br>

        <p>BRUSSELS, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- World major brands have expressed optimism about the potential of the Chinese
            market, as China's economy continues to grow, beating expectations, and their sales in China significantly
            increase.

            Germany's direct investment in China achieved a record high last year, according to a study by the German
            Economic Institute (IW) based on data from the German Federal Bank. In 2023, Germany's direct investment in
            China reached 11.9 billion euros (12.7 billion U.S. dollars), marking a 4 percent rise compared to the
            previous year, said the study.

            Since 2021, German direct investment in China has consistently reached new highs, with the data for 2023
            once again breaking historical records, said Juergen Matthes, a foreign trade expert at the IW, noting that
            multinational corporations, in particular, are increasingly focused on expanding their investments and
            maintaining growth in China.<br><br>

            The study also indicates that in 2023, German companies' direct investment in China accounted for 10 percent
            of Germany's total foreign investment, marking a significant increase. The cumulative investment in China
            over the past three years has matched the total investment in the six years from 2015 to 2020.

            In 2023, Bosch Group's sales in China reached 139.1 billion yuan (about 19.5 billion U.S. dollars), a 5.2
            percent year-on-year growth, with nearly 58,000 employees in the country.

            Despite various challenges and uncertainties in 2023, Bosch China achieved sustained and robust growth in
            2023 while the intelligent mobility business was the primary engine of its development in China, said Xu
            Daquan, president of Bosch China.<br><br>
        <blockquote class="highlight">
            China continues to be a key innovation and research hub for Bosch Group in addition to being a significant
            market. Bosch intends to maintain its stronghold in the Chinese market, make ongoing investments improve
            local manufacturing and research and development skills, grow local alliances, and provide more effective
            customer and market services while fostering company expansion, said Xu. </blockquote><br>

        John Pearson, the global chief executive officer of DHL Express, said in an interview with Xinhua that DHL
        is actively involved in and benefits from the economic development and industrial transformation in China.

        DHL's business in China grows together with the local market and partners, achieving mutual success through
        collaboration, he noted.

        DHL will keep pace with the rapid development of e-commerce in China by investing more in sustainability
        towards a greener future, said Pearson.<br><br>

        A recent article released by DHL highlighted that the sheer size of China's economy and its role in global
        trade make it too important to ignore for any international business.

        A flurry of new policies aimed at boosting economic recovery should support manufacturing and supply chain
        resilience. As the country steps up its international competitiveness, suggesting expanded opportunities for
        businesses, both export and import businesses continue to find compelling opportunities in China, said the
        article.

        "All over the world, we see at the present a trend for global protectionism. China's message for keeping
        open economies should be much appreciated. Protectionism has never brought additional value in the long
        term. These last 40 years the progressive openness of China has benefited itself as well as the rest of the
        world," said Bernard Dewit, chairman of the China-Belgium Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

        "The challenge is now, on the one hand, to keep our economies open while becoming greener and, on the other
        hand, to avoid increased social gaps as well as internally and internationally with a certain number of
        countries left behind," said Dewit.

        China's advocacy for "equal and orderly world multipolarity" is in line with the United Nation's philosophy,
        and shows that China wants to play a positive and active role in a peaceful and orderly development in the
        world at a time when tensions are present in many parts of our planet, he added. <br><br>

            BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese dragon, also known as the "loong," is prominent in Chinese
            mythology as a legendary and auspicious creature. Unlike their European counterparts, Chinese dragons don't
            exhale fire. Instead, they are often linked with water, symbolizing traits associated with business
            prosperity, abundant harvests and good health.<br><br>
